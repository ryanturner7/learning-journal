# Learning Journal 15

  Today I learned what to do when I run into a merge conflict on git. This will make combining group projects super easy because now we know how to get around the conflicts in order to merge code. Also, we started learning about JQuery which we won't need to apply until class 301. This does give me the opportunity to become familiar with the topic though. Also, we pitched projects ideas to the class and voted which ones will be used next week. This happened to be a fun process though and I'm excited for our projects!
