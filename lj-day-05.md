#Learning Journal 5
This week has been by far one of the toughest weeks of my life. With that being said, I already feel so much more skilled at programming and just writing code in general after only one week. This class has been quite intense but also tons of fun. I personally find it exciting to see myself quickly improving. Although I may get frustrated, I keep my mind on the bigger picture which keeps me going. Once I have the skill of coding mastered, I'm going to be able to just let loose and have fun. Even though this class has been super hard compared to what I'm used to, I do feel as if I've learned more this week than I ever have in my life. Thats what makes this program what it is. After a whole week in the books, I can say that I'm incredibly happy with my decision to join code fellows.
