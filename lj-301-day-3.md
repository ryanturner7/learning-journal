# LJ Code 301 - Day 3

Today I learned how to create a handler to make a functioning "read on" link on a webpage, using jQuery. This allows me to display only part of an article on the webpage until the user clicks on it, displaying the rest of the article. This was made possible by using this bit of code which my partner and I spent a large amount of time to finally make work.
var articleSelected = $(this).siblings('.article-body')
articleSelected.children().show();
I find it fascinating how much time and effort you will put into overthinking a problem and changing your code, when you were already so close to making it work. Today was difficult but I can say that I feel accomplished!
