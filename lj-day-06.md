#Learning Journal 6
Today I learned how to manipulate the DOM without using constructors. We created objects to do so which made the process long but I was able to see the steps that I took to do so. I started the project at 1 oclock in lab today, and I didn't finish until 11:30 tonight. It has been a long day but I am glad that I can go to bed happy, knowing that I learned so much today. It amazes me to see how much information I learn everyday about coding which excites me and keeps me motivated to proceed to learn. This class is super challenging but it makes me feel accomplished when I manage to finish an assignment like todays. All in all, it was another great day in class and I'm excited for what is to come. Now I need to catch a midnight dinner!
