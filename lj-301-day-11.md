# LJ Code 301 - Day 11

Today I learned all about the Model View Controller. This was the first time that we were able to dive deep into the subject and it was much more extensive than I had assumed. This included us changing event handlers into controllers which required us to refactor the handling functions which simplified the code a lot. Also, I learned how to keep all of my script tags organized when I have so many and which ones rely on the next.
