# LJ Code 301 - Day 11

Today, I learned how we should really plan for a project as a team. First of all, one major lesson that I took away from 201 project was the fact that your initial planning dictates the process of the team project. We discussed thoroughly what we were going to do throughout the week. One thing that we didn't discuss as a team before was our git workflow, which my current team did a great job of doing. Because of our solid planning on Friday, I feel as if we are ready as a team to show you what Seattle is reading!
