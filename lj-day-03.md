# First Learning Journal
    With two days of class in the books, I can honestly say that I've learned a whole lot. I'll admit, I felt as if I was entering the class fairly unprepared. I finished my pre-work but still didn't feel too confident with the material. We've been incredibly immersed in content since the class started. These first two days have already made this the most intense class that I have taken, not to mention the longest class as well. Although this class may get frustrating, I'm really enjoying the challenge of it. There isn't much of a better feeling than finally solving a problem that you've been stuck on in your code. The command line has by far been my biggest challenge, however I've been adapting to it. I feel as if the concept of the terminal is just super complex and requires a lot of practice to get comfortable with. My goal is to conquer the terminal and utilize the benefits. So far, I have had a few issues while working in the command line which is expected. The TA's have done a great job of helping those in need, like myself.
    Aside from the command line, I have been really enjoying the Javascript that we have been writing. In JS, we have only really worked with prompts, confirms and alerts. Because of this, I have been becoming much more comfortable with these few topics. I am super excited to see my own progression in this class because coding was a foreign subject to me just months ago that I recently found passion in. Also, I feel as if this journaling assignment will be totally beneficial because it gives you that needed time to reflect on the class.
    All in all, I would say that I'm enjoying this class to the fullest and am going to put forth my best effort.
