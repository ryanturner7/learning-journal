# LJ Code 301 - Day 8
Today I learned I strengthened my understanding of node using npm commands. When we learned them yesterday, the whole concept wasn't too clear to me. Since Sam gave us a solid demonstration in class, I was able to understand which commands I need to use when installing node packages. It is now clear to me that I need to use npm init when initializing a new project and only need to use npm i when trying to add a dependency to an already established project. Also, use npm i --save when saving a package to local machine and -g to save it at a global scale.
